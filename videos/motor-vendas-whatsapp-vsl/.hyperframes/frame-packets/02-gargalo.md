Adapt: manter a acumulação que cerca o centro; substituir ícones de ferramentas por quatro tarefas reais do fluxo comercial e terminar abrindo espaço para a oferta contextual.

Scene 1 (0.0–2.1s): “O GARGALO NÃO É CRIAR” ocupa o centro sobre a imagem real escurecida; dois cartões entram pelas laterais, “PROCURAR” e “PESQUISAR” — layered-depth com título dominante.
Scene 2 (2.1–6.0s): os cartões “ENTENDER” e “ABORDAR” chegam por cima e por baixo, cercando o centro à medida que a locução os nomeia; conectores se desenham e a densidade sobe sem cobrir o título.
Scene 3 (6.0–8.853s): os quatro cartões são empurrados para as bordas num corte de velocidade e revelam “UMA OFERTA QUE FAZ SENTIDO” em campo claro; a frase segura imóvel.

## Selected blueprint: overwhelm-surround

# overwhelm-surround — Overwhelm / Close-In

**intent**: Convey overwhelm by accumulation. Recognizable subjects assemble, density markers scatter in to amplify "look how much," then the central subject morphs into the viewer's own avatar and elements close in from ALL sides — the frame feels surrounded, not zoomed-into. The emotional arc is recognition → claustrophobia.

**roles served**

- Problem (from `problem-mockup-overwhelm`): when the problem beat must first show "too many tools / too much surface area" and then put **the viewer inside it** — a literal swap of subject (product → person) followed by a closing-in that feels invasive. Reach for it when the pain is "you're buried," not "this metric is bad" (that's `dataviz-countup`).
- Problem (from `desktop-clutter-accumulation`): when the overwhelm is a **workspace**, not a tool
  count — live windows, stickies, and alert toasts pile up until the frame is chaotically full, and
  the beat resolves not by closing in but by shoving the clutter aside and asking the question.
  Reach for this variant when the pain lands on words ("how can you X… when you spend months on
  Y?"), not on a surrounded avatar.

**duration**: 6–9s (clutter-shove-to-question variant ~10s)

**shot structure** (a `[bg]` canvas; recognizable surfaces first, the viewer's avatar revealed underneath, then a radial crowd)

- **Scene 1 (0.0–~1.6s) — recognizable assembly.** Three `[product mockups / surfaces]` assemble into something the viewer knows — staggered scale-in, the **center** one full-size, the two flanks smaller (~0.86). Each rides a low-amplitude float so they feel like live context, not a static collage. Camera static.
- **Scene 2 (~1.6–3.0s) — density amplifies.** `[platform icons / logos]` scatter in around the mockups (staggered), used purely as **density markers** — "look how much surface area," not animated dials.
- **Scene 3 (~3.0–4.6s) — the morph (signature move).** The CENTER mockup MORPHS: its content fades out, the container reshapes, and the viewer's `[avatar]` is revealed **underneath** — a literal swap of subject, product → person.
- **Scene 4 (~4.6–end) — close-in.** `[task bubbles / demands]` close in from ALL sides toward the avatar (radial staggered entry). The avatar **stays put** while the bubbles invade — the claustrophobia comes from being surrounded, never from a camera push. Holds on the crowded state.
- **Variant — clutter-shove-to-question** (replaces Scenes 3–4 and
  inverts the camera contract — see modifier): accumulation runs under a **slow steady zoom-out** —
  `[sticky notes]` bounce in springy, `[dashboard / editor windows]` pop and slide up, a stack of
  `[alert toasts]` slides in at one edge, inner content keeps typing / log-scrolling as live density,
  windows overlap until the frame is chaotically full. The camera then REVERSES into a quick
  push-in that **shoves the clutter to the frame edges**, opening central negative space where a
  `[two-part serif question]` builds word-by-word (line 1 swaps in place to line 2); a `[cursor]`
  glides in from off-frame and comes to rest under the text; a very slow forward creep and hold.
  No morph, no avatar — the question is the payoff.

**motion vocabulary**: staggered scale-in assembly; resting-scale-preserving low float; density-marker icon scatter; content-fade → container-reshape → reveal-anchor-beneath morph; radial close-in entry from all compass points; held crowded end-state. Clutter-shove variant: slow steady zoom-out under accumulation; reverse quick push-in; clutter
shoved to frame edges opening center negative space; continuous live typing / log scroll inside
windows as ambient density; toast-stack slide-in; word-by-word serif build with in-place line swap;
cursor glide-to-rest; very slow forward creep + hold.

**rule mapping**

- staggered mockup + icon entries (smooth settle onto their resting scale) → `spring-pop-entrance` (smooth-settle register) backed by `gsap-effects`
- platform icons as density markers (positions pre-baked, scale/opacity only — NOT internal-parts animation) → `svg-icon-enrichment` (its DOM contract only)
- center mockup → avatar morph (HF forbids `width`/`height` tweens → drive the reshape on `scaleX`/`scaleY`, anchor = the avatar layer rendered beneath) → `card-morph-anchor`
- radial bubble close-in (positions baked once via `cos`/`sin`, staggered entry) → `gsap-effects` (radial layout) + `spring-pop-entrance` (per-bubble arrival)
- low-amplitude float on background mockups/icons → `sine-wave-loop` (low-amplitude register — subtle jitter that composes onto each element's resting scale, never a `fromTo` yoyo that re-tweens to its start)
- (variant) zoom-out under accumulation → quick push-in → slow forward creep → `multi-phase-camera`
  (pull-back / push / drift as sequential phases on one world wrapper; counter-translate math in
  `viewport-change`)
- (variant) clutter shoved to the edges as the push-in lands → `center-outward-expansion` (outward
  vectors to edge resting positions), fired at the same timeline position as the camera push so the
  shove reads as CAUSED by it (`reactive-displacement` register)
- (variant) word-by-word serif question build → `gsap-effects` (staggered word reveal); the
  in-place line-1 → line-2 swap → `discrete-text-sequence`
- (variant) live typing inside windows → `gsap-effects` (typewriter); the continuous inner
  log-scroll — composition: looping content translateY via `gsap-effects` (masked)
- (variant) cursor glide-in coming to rest → `cursor-click-ripple` (approach portion only — no click)

**camera modifier**: camera-static — the close-in must read as the world crowding the subject, so the frame holds; a push-in would convert "surrounded" into "zoomed-into" and kill the claustrophobia. The clutter-shove-to-question variant is the sanctioned exception: there the camera IS the
storyteller (zoom-out ↔ push-in via `multi-phase-camera`), and the claustrophobia comes from
accumulation, not surround — never mix the two resolutions in one shot.

## Selected motion rule: center-outward-expansion

description: Elements start clustered at screen center and expand outward to their final positions, driven by a shared progress value.

# Center-Outward Expansion

Elements begin at one shared center point and radiate outward to their final positions — the entry beat itself, or motion driven by another animation's progress (a counting number, a beat). Flat 2D cousin of [depth-scatter-assemble.md](depth-scatter-assemble.md) (per-element 3D cloud): here every element shares the SAME origin.

## How It Works

Each element carries its final offset as `data-target-x/y`. Its position lerps between center and target: `x = targetX × progress`. Self-centering is baked as `xPercent/yPercent: -50` so the tweened `x`/`y` are pure offsets from the stage center. Standalone burst = per-item staggered `fromTo`; driven burst = one shared proxy (see Variations).

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="burst-wrap">
  <div class="burst-item" data-target-x="-360" data-target-y="-180">{itemA}</div>
  <div class="burst-item" data-target-x="360" data-target-y="-180">{itemB}</div>
  <div class="burst-item" data-target-x="0" data-target-y="360">{itemC}</div>
</div>
```

```css
.burst-wrap {
  position: relative;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
}
.burst-item {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%; /* GSAP xPercent/yPercent -50 bakes the centering; x/y tween the offset */
  will-change: transform;
}
```

```js
document.querySelectorAll(".burst-item").forEach((el, i) => {
  tl.fromTo(
    el,
    { xPercent: -50, yPercent: -50, x: 0, y: 0, scale: 0.6, opacity: 0 },
    {
      x: Number(el.dataset.targetX),
      y: Number(el.dataset.targetY),
      scale: 1,
      opacity: 1,
      duration: EXPAND_DUR,
      ease: EXPAND_EASE,
    },
    ENTRY_AT + i * STAGGER,
  );
});
```

## Variations

- **Synced to a driver (chord)**: when the burst shadows a counter / beat, drop the stagger and drive all items from ONE 0→1 proxy tween with the driver's exact duration AND ease; `onUpdate` writes `translate(-50%,-50%) translate(targetX*p, targetY*p)` per item — the two read as one beat.
- **Partially-spread start**: with 6+ items the full cluster piles up — start from `{ x: targetX * START_PROGRESS, ... }`.
- **Idle micro-float**: hand off to [sine-wave-loop.md](sine-wave-loop.md) after landing instead of freezing.

## Values

| token          | range                | notes                                                            |
| -------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ITEM_COUNT     | 3–8                  | > 8 = visual chaos mid-expansion; low counts want wider spread   |
| EXPAND_DUR     | 1.0–1.8s             | must equal the driver's duration in the synced variant           |
| EXPAND_EASE    | `power3.out` default | `power2.out` gentler, `expo.out` dramatic stop; NEVER `in` eases |
| STAGGER        | 0.04–0.08s           | tighter = chord; looser = lazy arpeggio                          |
| ENTRY_AT       | 0–0.5s               | a beat of compositional quiet before the burst                   |
| START_PROGRESS | 0–0.5                | 0 = dramatic full cluster; ~0.3 avoids the pile-up               |

## Critical Constraints

- **Tween `x`/`y` over the baked `xPercent/yPercent: -50`** — mutating `left`/`top` fights the centering and causes pixel jitter.
- **Out-easing only** — `in` easings read as items being sucked back mid-air.
- **No other absolute-positioned siblings inside `.burst-wrap`** — they'd steal the centered baseline.
- **❗ The burst IS the beat** — don't park a "real headline" label below it (the eye snaps to the label and ignores the burst). If a label is needed, reveal it post-burst in the same stack.
- Synced variant: identical duration + ease as the driver, or the chord falls apart.

## Selected motion rule: viewport-change

name: viewport-change
description: Virtual camera — simulate zoom / pan / focus-lock by transforming a wrapper around all scene content. Camera moves right → world translates left.
metadata:
  tags: viewport, camera, zoom, pan, focus-lock, virtual-camera

# Viewport Change (Virtual Camera)

Simulates camera effects (zoom / pan / focus-lock on a moving element) by transforming a wrapper around ALL scene content. The "world" moves opposite to the perceived camera. Distinct from [multi-phase-camera](multi-phase-camera.md) (2-3 discrete phases + drift) — viewport-change is a single continuous zoom/pan, often used for focus-lock following a moving element.

## How It Works

Camera intent → world transform. Camera **pans right** → world `translateX(-distance)`; camera **zooms in** → world `scale(>1)`; camera **follows element X** → world `translateX(viewportCenter - elementWorldX)` per-frame. Get the sign right or everything moves the wrong way. The single `.world` wrapper holds the camera transform; elements inside are positioned in world space, unchanged.

**Single-element composite transform (this rule's form).** Both scale and translate live on ONE wrapper as `translate(x, y) scale(S)`. CSS applies scale FIRST, then translate (right-to-left matrix composition), so a point at world offset `(ox, oy)` lands on screen at `(S × ox + x, S × oy + y)`. To map the target to viewport center, solve `S × offset + T = 0`:

```
T = -offset × S
```

This is **different from [coordinate-target-zoom](coordinate-target-zoom.md)**, which uses two nested wrappers (outer scales, inner translates) and derives `T = -offset` (independent of S). Mixing up the two forms drifts the target off-center as scale changes. Use this single-wrapper form when you want one source of truth for camera state (`cam.scale`, `cam.x`, `cam.y`) written via `onUpdate`; use nested wrappers when scale and translate can tween independently with shared ease.

## Recipe

```html
<div class="world" id="world">
  <div class="content">
    <div class="hero">{Brand}</div>
    <div class="tagline">{tagline}</div>
    <div class="cta" id="cta">{ctaUrl}</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.scene {
  overflow: hidden; /* REQUIRED — any non-1.0 scale reveals edges or pushes content off-frame */
  background: {bgGradient}; /* on .scene, NOT .world — a world-borne background warps with the camera */
}
.world {
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  display: grid;
  place-items: center;
  transform-origin: 50% 50%; /* centered scaling is what the math assumes */
  will-change: transform;
}
```

```js
const world = document.getElementById("world");

// Camera state — single source of truth. The world transform is composed from
// this object in ONE place so the transform string order is stable.
const cam = { scale: 1, x: 0, y: 0 };
function applyCamera() {
  world.style.transform = `translate(${cam.x}px, ${cam.y}px) scale(${cam.scale})`;
}
applyCamera(); // seed frame 0

// Zoom in on the CTA: single-element composite transform → T = -offset × S.
// TARGET_OFFSET_Y is the target's measured offset from viewport center at
// neutral camera (sign matters — positive = below center).
const counterY = -TARGET_OFFSET_Y * TARGET_SCALE;

tl.to(
  cam,
  {
    scale: TARGET_SCALE,
    y: counterY,
    duration: ZOOM_DUR,
    ease: "power3.inOut",
    onUpdate: applyCamera,
  },
  ZOOM_START,
);
```

## Scale Value Guide

| Effect      | Scale       | Feel                                |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Subtle      | 1.02 - 1.05 | Barely perceptible — "professional" |
| Medium      | 1.05 - 1.15 | "Ta-da" emphasis                    |
| Noticeable  | 1.15 - 1.30 | Focus on region                     |
| Dramatic    | 1.5 - 2.5   | Element fills screen                |
| Full-screen | 3.0+        | Element covers viewport             |

Perception: < 5% scale change is imperceptible; 10-15% is comfortable emphasis; > 30% is cinematic/dramatic. For a natural product feel, prefer 1.05-1.15× over 2-3s; save big > 1.3× zooms for dramatic narrative moments.

### Extreme range — 4–12× outward (workspace reveal)

The same single-cam math runs far past the table: a zoom-out workspace reveal opens punched-in at **4–12×** on one detail (a single cell, message, or button) and pulls out to the full workspace in one continuous move. The mechanics don't change — one `cam` object, `T = -offset × S`, one `applyCamera()` writer — only the authoring direction does:

- **Build the workspace at its final (1×) layout and OPEN scaled-in** (`cam.scale = 8`, counter-translate aiming the opening detail; state it in a `fromTo` / seed via `applyCamera()` so a seek to t=0 lands punched-in). The wide landing frame is then everything at native design size — text crisp, raster assets at source resolution.
- **Never the inverse** — authoring the close-up at 1× and scaling the world down to 0.08–0.25 for the wide frame drops every label below legible pixel size and softens raster media; the reveal lands on mush.
- **Measure the opening target** — at S = 8, a 1 px error in the baked offset is 8 px on screen at the opening pose. Take the offset from the target's real laid-out center (`getBoundingClientRect` after `fonts.ready`, once at setup — the measuring doctrine in [coordinate-target-zoom.md](coordinate-target-zoom.md)), never from a layout formula.
- **The opening detail must survive ×S** — it renders at `S ×` its design size on the first frames (vector/DOM text is safe; raster needs `sourceResolution ≥ rendered × S`).

## Variations

- **Focus-lock (camera follows a moving cursor/character)** — keep the element at a fixed screen X by computing the world offset per-frame inside the driver's `onUpdate`:

```js
const focusEl = document.querySelector(".moving-cursor");
const targetScreenX = VIEWPORT_WIDTH * FOCUS_SCREEN_X_FRAC; // 0.4–0.7; 0.5 = dead center
const focusUpdate = { p: 0 };
tl.to(
  focusUpdate,
  {
    p: 1,
    duration: FOLLOW_DUR, // matches how long the focused element is in motion
    ease: "power2.inOut",
    onUpdate: () => {
      const rect = focusEl.getBoundingClientRect();
      cam.x = targetScreenX - (rect.left + rect.width / 2);
      applyCamera();
    },
  },
  FOLLOW_START,
);
```

- **Composite scale (multi-phase)** — two proxy tweens multiplied through one writer: `cam.scale = scaleUp.v * scaleDown.v; applyCamera()`. Combine a slow push-in (~1.15) with a brief release (~0.9) for a breath/punch shape.
- **Camera mode transition (centered → follow)** — crossfade two camera modes via a 0→1 weight tween; intermediate frames interpolate between the modes' offsets.

## Critical Constraints

- **One `.world` wrapper carries the whole camera** — every scene element lives inside it; a second transformed wrapper is a second camera.
- **Single source of truth via the `cam` object + `applyCamera()`** — when scale and translate both change, write them in ONE place; never split them across tweens that touch `world.style.transform` directly (the transform string composition order becomes unpredictable).
- **Single-wrapper counter-translate is `T = -offset × S`** — don't import the nested-wrapper `T = -offset` formula.
- **`overflow: hidden` on `.scene`**; **`transform-origin: 50% 50%` on `.world`**; **background on `.scene`, never on `.world`**.
