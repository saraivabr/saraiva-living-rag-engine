Adapt: manter a condensação do hero no botão e o clique humano; anteceder o morph com duas frases de transparência para reduzir risco.

Scene 1 (0.0–3.3s): sobre a captura real escurecida, “NÃO PROMETE VENDA AUTOMÁTICA” revela em duas linhas no centro; “venda automática” recebe o acento verde apenas quando é dito.
Scene 2 (3.3–6.0s): a frase anterior cede lugar a “VOCÊ REVISA O PRIMEIRO CONTATO” e “VOCÊ CONDUZ A CONVERSA”, uma de cada vez, com ícones de revisão e conversa.
Scene 3 (6.0–9.3s): os textos condensam no mesmo centro e viram a pergunta “PROMPT OU MOTOR DE VENDAS?”; logo abaixo surge o botão “ESCOLHER COMO ENTRAR”.
Scene 4 (9.3–11.819s): um cursor chega de fora, pousa levemente fora do centro e pressiona o botão; a confirmação “LOJA.SARAIVA.AI” aparece e segura até o fim.

## Selected blueprint: cta-morph-press

# cta-morph-press — CTA Morph & Press

**intent**: A resting brand mark condenses at the same screen center into a smaller, brighter CTA, then a cursor arrives from off-stage and lands a human-aimed click on it. The viewer's eye is walked from "this is who we are" to "and this is what you do." The morph and the click are the two headline beats.

**roles served**

- CTA (from `cta-morph-press`): when the close moves from brand identity to a single user action, two elements share the same center sequentially (a morph, not a cut), and the payoff is a simulated click with physical feedback. Reach for it for a focused "click here" sign-off — no spatial set, no multi-step UI (that's `cursor-ui-demo`).
- Hook (ROLE-WIDENED, from `widget-morph-on-blank-field`): the same
  machinery run as an OPENER — a lone `[widget]` (pill / chip lockup) on a flat field transforms
  in place, performs its payload, then vanishes to a plain frame that a typed `[title]` resolves.
  The click, when present, ignites the morph rather than closing it; there may be no cursor at
  all. Reach for it when the product hook IS one widget doing one thing — still no spatial set,
  no multi-step UI (that's `cursor-ui-demo`). Mint-reconsideration trigger: if future mining
  brings 2+ more widget-morph openers with the vanish → typed-title resolve, promote this variant
  to its own blueprint (the beat order is fully inverted by then).

**duration**: 4–6s (Hook widget-morph opener 5–7.5s)

**shot structure** (a `[bg]` canvas; hero and CTA are flex-centered siblings sharing one `transform-origin`)

- **Scene 1 (0.0–~1.4s) — presence.** The `[hero mark / brand lockup]` holds dead-center, alive but resting — only a faint rotational breath on the mark; any title text under it stays rock-stable. Camera static.
- **Scene 2 (~1.4–2.4s) — the morph (signature move).** The hero CONDENSES at the same screen center into a smaller, brighter `[CTA]` (button / card): the outgoing mark shrink-fades exactly as the CTA scales up in its place. Because they share one `transform-origin`, the eye reads it as one element transforming, not a swap.
- **Scene 3 (~2.4–3.4s) — approach.** A `[cursor]` arrives from off-stage on a **decelerating** path (it "arrives," it does not pass through) and lands a few px **off** the CTA's geometric center, so the aim reads human, not scripted.
- **Scene 4 (~3.4–end) — press.** The cursor lands a physical CLICK — cursor and CTA compress together in lockstep, then release with feedback (an optional ripple / glow bloom). Holds on the clicked state.
- **Variant — Hook (widget-morph opener)** (from `widget-morph-on-blank-field`;
  reorders the beats — press first, morph second, title last). **(1) presence**: a lone
  `[pill / chip lockup]` sits centered on a flat `[field]`; optionally the `[cursor]` glides in, a
  hover pill-background appears behind the chip, and the click lands with the same lockstep press.
  **(2) the morph**: the widget transforms IN PLACE — expands downward anchored at its top edge
  into a `[menu]`, or spring-morphs outward into a `[prompt card]` with a small overshoot settle —
  new content fades/slides into place. **(3) payload**: the transformed state performs —
  `[placeholder]` types with a blinking caret, `[user text]` types while a control flips from
  muted to its vibrant active color, or the menu snap-collapses back to the pill carrying the
  `[new value]` + a checkmark pop; the background may snap to a new color under the persistent
  foreground card. **(4) resolve**: the widget VANISHES; a plain frame closes the beat — a
  `[closing title]` types on center, or a hold on the flipped solid.

**motion vocabulary**: faint rotation-only resting breath (logo scope only); same-center morph-swap (shrink-fade ↔ scale-up sharing `transform-origin`); cursor decel-arrival from off-stage; off-center human aim; lockstep press compression; release feedback ripple / glow. Hook opener: anchored downward expand of a pill into a menu and springy snap-collapse back;
chip-to-card spring morph with overshoot settle; placeholder / user-text typewriter with blinking
caret (may cut mid-word); control color-state flip muted → vibrant; background color snap under a
persistent foreground card; checkmark pop; widget vanish to blank frame; typed closing title.

**rule mapping**

- hero → CTA condense at one center → `scale-swap-transition` (shared `transform-origin: 50% 50%` is what sells the morph; CTA `position: absolute` so it doesn't shove the hero during the brief overlap)
- resting-hero aliveness (rotation only, scoped to the mark so the Phase-2 scale doesn't fight it) → `sine-wave-loop` (low-amplitude rotation register — subtle jitter, not a scale breath)
- cursor press + release in lockstep (single-target-array so both compress together) → `physics-press-reaction` (PRESS_DOWN + RELEASE portion)
- cursor approach (decel from off-stage, off-center landing, hard-cut opacity in) → `gsap-effects` (translate on `power2.out`)
- click ripple / release glow → `cursor-click-ripple` (attack-decay ring) and/or `ambient-glow-bloom` (release bloom)
- (Hook) chip → prompt-card spring morph at one center → `scale-swap-transition` (the base morph
  contract, run in the expand direction) + `card-morph-anchor` (corner-radius / surface ride-along)
- (Hook) anchored-edge expand / snap-collapse (pill ↔ menu, top edge pinned) →
  `anchored-layout-expand` (edge-anchored directional container growth — origin-pinned expansion
  with counter-scaled children; `card-morph-anchor` stays for uniform-scale morphs only)
- (Hook) placeholder + user typing, blinking caret, mid-word cut → `gsap-effects` (typewriter) +
  `context-sensitive-cursor` (blink) + `discrete-text-sequence` (mid-word cut states)
- (Hook) control color flip muted → vibrant → `press-release-spring` (color-transition variation)
- (Hook) checkmark pop / card-arrival overshoot → `spring-pop-entrance`
- (Hook) hover pill-background + igniting click → the base's `physics-press-reaction` +
  `cursor-click-ripple` mappings apply unchanged

**camera modifier**: camera-static — the morph and click happen in element space; a camera move would compete with the click as the climax. The Hook opener keeps the same contract — even the background color flip is an element-level
snap, not a camera event.

description: Replace entire text states at frame thresholds for non-linear typing effects — typos, bulk additions, pauses, backspaces, simulated thinking.

# Discrete Text Sequence

Instead of character-by-character typewriter, replace entire string states at time thresholds — enabling non-linear effects (typos, backspaces, bulk paste, "thinking" gaps) that smooth per-char typing can't achieve. If your effect is "type each character, no edits", this rule is overkill — use the smooth-slice variation below.

## How It Works

The typing is authored as a sparse array of `{ t, text }` states; on every `onUpdate` a **reverse search** finds the latest entry whose `t` has passed and renders its text. Display jumps between states with no animation between them — the realism comes from the schedule shape: fast keystroke clusters (0.06–0.20s apart), pauses at word breaks (0.3–0.6s), a typo, backspaces peeling back to the fork, then a bulk paste replacing many chars in one entry. A block cursor blinks via a deterministic sin square wave on the same timeline.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="terminal">
  <div class="prompt">$</div>
  <div class="text-wrap">
    <span class="text" id="text"></span><span class="cursor" id="cursor">_</span>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.terminal {
  font-family: {monoFont}; /* monospace required — proportional jitters even in a fixed box */
  display: flex;
  align-items: baseline;
  font-size: TERMINAL_FONT_SIZE;
}
.text-wrap {
  display: inline-flex;
  align-items: baseline;
  min-width: TEXT_WRAP_MIN_WIDTH; /* ≥ widest state — stops right-edge jitter */
  white-space: nowrap;
}
.cursor {
  display: inline-block; /* inline ignores width */
  width: CURSOR_WIDTH;
}
```

```js
// Each entry shows from its t until the NEXT entry's t.
// Shape: keystrokes → typo → backspace to the fork → bulk paste → completion mark.
const SEQUENCE = [
  { t: 0.0, text: "" },
  { t: T_K1, text: "{p1}" }, // first keystrokes (~3-5 chars, 0.1-0.2s apart)
  { t: T_K2, text: "{p1 + ' ' + p2_typo}" }, // continuation containing a typo
  { t: T_BS, text: "{p1 + ' ' + p2_partial}" }, // backspace(s) — peel back to the fork
  { t: T_BULK, text: "{fullCorrectedText}" }, // bulk paste — many chars in one jump
  { t: T_DONE, text: "{fullCorrectedText + ' ✓'}" }, // completion marker
];

// Reverse-search for the latest entry whose t has passed
function textAt(time) {
  for (let i = SEQUENCE.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (time >= SEQUENCE[i].t) return SEQUENCE[i].text;
  }
  return "";
}

const textEl = document.getElementById("text");
const cursorEl = document.getElementById("cursor");

const driver = { t: 0 };
tl.to(
  driver,
  {
    t: TOTAL_DURATION,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      textEl.textContent = textAt(driver.t);
    },
  },
  0,
);

// Cursor blink — deterministic sin square wave, never a CSS animation
const blink = { p: 0 };
tl.to(
  blink,
  {
    p: Math.PI * 2 * BLINK_CYCLES,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      cursorEl.style.opacity = Math.sin(blink.p) > 0 ? "1" : "0";
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

## Variations

- **Smooth character slice** (continuous typewriter — no pauses, no edits): faster to author but uniformly "machine-typed", missing the human realism:

```js
const fullText = "{fullPhrase}";
const len = { v: 0 };
tl.to(
  len,
  {
    v: fullText.length,
    duration: TYPE_DUR,
    ease: "power1.inOut",
    onUpdate: () => {
      textEl.textContent = fullText.substring(0, Math.floor(len.v));
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

- **Thinking pause** — hold one state for `THINK_HOLD_DUR` (0.8–2.0s; under 0.5s reads as a stutter, not thought) simply by leaving a gap before the next entry's `t`.
- **State pulse on completion** — when the final state lands, `tl.to(".text", { scale: 1.03–1.08, duration: 0.15–0.3, yoyo: true, repeat: 1 }, T_DONE)`.
- **Per-state color shift** — in `onUpdate`, branch on `driver.t` vs the milestones: success color after `T_DONE`, dim mid-edit, normal while typing.

## Critical Constraints

- **Reverse-search the array each frame** — O(n) with small n (≤30 typical); don't index by frame, the sequence is sparse.
- **`min-width` on the text wrap is mandatory** — without it the right edge jitters as state length changes.
- **Discrete jumps must be INSTANT** — any transition on the text turns the jump into a smear and kills the "typing" feel.
- **Cursor blink is sin/sequence-driven on the timeline**, `display: inline-block`, monospace font, `white-space: nowrap` (wrapping mid-state breaks the illusion; trailing spaces must survive).
- **Discrete vs smooth** — use discrete only for non-linear states (typos, pauses, bulk paste); plain typing takes the smooth-slice variation.

## Selected motion rule: scale-swap-transition

description: Coordinated shrink-out + spring pop-in morph-like transition between two elements — no SVG path interpolation needed.

  tags: transition, morph, scale, swap, spring, pop

# Scale-Swap Transition

Simulates a "morph" between two DOM elements by overlapping exit and entrance scale animations. Lighter weight than [card-morph-anchor.md](card-morph-anchor.md) (which morphs container dimensions — use that for SHAPE changes; this rule is for SAME-shape state swaps) and easier than SVG path interpolation.

At a single trigger, two coordinated tweens fire:

1. **Outgoing**: scale `1.0 → EXIT_SCALE` + opacity `1 → 0`, fast `power2.in` (rushing away).
2. **Incoming**: scale `EXIT_SCALE → 1.0` + opacity `0 → 1`, `back.out(BOUNCE_FACTOR)` (arriving with weight).

A small `OVERLAP` window during which both are mid-tween creates the morph illusion; the incoming sits on top via z-index so the outgoing's fade-tail doesn't bleed through.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- Both cards position: absolute; inset: 0 in one fixed-size wrapper — same
     footprint, same transform-origin: 50% 50%. Incoming starts opacity: 0,
     transform: scale(EXIT_SCALE), z-index above the outgoing. -->
<div class="swap-wrap">
  <div class="card outgoing" id="outgoing">{outgoingIcon} {outgoingLabel}</div>
  <div class="card incoming" id="incoming">
    {incomingIcon} {incomingLabel}
    <div class="sub" id="sub">{incomingSubline}</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

```js
// Outgoing: shrink + fade fast
tl.to(
  "#outgoing",
  { scale: EXIT_SCALE, opacity: 0, duration: EXIT_DUR, ease: "power2.in" },
  TRIGGER,
);

// Incoming: pops in with overshoot, starting OVERLAP before the exit finishes
tl.to(
  "#incoming",
  { scale: 1.0, opacity: 1, duration: ENTER_DUR, ease: `back.out(${BOUNCE_FACTOR})` },
  TRIGGER + EXIT_DUR - OVERLAP,
);

// Inner content reveals AFTER the incoming settles
tl.fromTo(
  "#sub",
  { opacity: 0, y: SUB_REVEAL_Y_PX },
  { opacity: 1, y: 0, duration: SUB_REVEAL_DUR, ease: "power3.out" },
  TRIGGER + EXIT_DUR + SUB_REVEAL_DELAY,
);
```

## Variations

- **Delayed inner content reveal** — the classic pattern above: morph the container, then reveal inner text once it settles; the 0.2–0.4 s gap lets the eye land on the new shape before reading.
- **Triple swap (3-state cycle)** — chain A→B→C with triggers `TRIGGER_AB` / `TRIGGER_BC`; each transition is its own tween pair, the previous incoming becoming the next outgoing. State-evolution narratives (early → mid → final labels).
- **Color-shift transition (no scale)** — for a flat morph between same-shape states, drop the scale and keep opacity + a brief background hue tween; less dramatic, more product-UI tone.

## Critical Constraints

- **Incoming z-index ABOVE outgoing** — otherwise the outgoing's fade-tail (opacity 0.3–0.5) bleeds through and double-exposes the frame.
- **Both elements share `transform-origin: 50% 50%`** — different origins make the morph read as one thing teleporting elsewhere.
- **Bouncy ease ONLY on the incoming** — outgoing `power2.in`, incoming `back.out`; reversed, the swap feels mechanical.
- **Both cards `position: absolute; inset: 0`** in the same fixed-size wrapper (sized to fit both states; the wrap never resizes).
- **Don't `display: none` the outgoing** after the fade — leave it at `opacity: 0` so layout doesn't reflow.
- **Inner content reveals after the container settles**; **climax dwell ≥ 1 s** after the final state + subline land.

description: Animated mouse cursor moves to target, clicks with scale depression and expanding ripple rings.

  tags: cursor, click, ripple, interaction, mouse, button

# Cursor Click Ripple

An animated cursor moves to a target element, performs a click with visual depression, and emits expanding ripple rings from the click point. Three sequential phases on one timeline: **move** (eased translation to the target's center) → **click** (scale depression on cursor + target together, yoyo back) → **ripple** (1–3 staggered rings expand and fade from the click point). This is a _point event at one location_ — a sustained hold across space is [cursor-drag.md](cursor-drag.md).

## Recipe

```html
<button class="target-button">{ctaLabel}</button>
<div class="cursor"><!-- arrow SVG, positioned at the entry corner --></div>
<!-- Rings live in DOM from t=0 at the click-target CENTER, scale 0 + opacity 0 -->
<div class="ripple ripple-1"></div>
<div class="ripple ripple-2"></div>
<div class="ripple ripple-3"></div>
```

```css
.ripple {
  position: absolute;
  left: 50%;
  top: 50%; /* click-target center */
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  border-radius: 50%;
  border: 2px solid {rippleColor};
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%) scale(0);
  opacity: 0;
  pointer-events: none;
}
```

```js
// Phase 1 — Move: eased, not linear
tl.to(".cursor", { x: TARGET_X, y: TARGET_Y, duration: MOVE_DUR, ease: MOVE_EASE }, 0);

// Phase 2 — Click: cursor + target depress together, then return
tl.to(
  ".cursor",
  { scale: CURSOR_PRESS_SCALE, duration: PRESS_DUR, ease: "power2.in", yoyo: true, repeat: 1 },
  CLICK_AT,
);
tl.to(
  ".target-button",
  { scale: TARGET_PRESS_SCALE, duration: PRESS_DUR, ease: "power2.in", yoyo: true, repeat: 1 },
  CLICK_AT,
);

// Phase 3 — Ripple burst, N rings staggered from the click point
tl.set([".ripple-1", ".ripple-2", ".ripple-3"], { opacity: 1 }, RIPPLE_AT);
tl.to(
  [".ripple-1", ".ripple-2", ".ripple-3"],
  {
    scale: RIPPLE_SCALE,
    opacity: 0,
    duration: RIPPLE_DUR,
    ease: RIPPLE_EASE,
    stagger: RIPPLE_STAGGER,
    immediateRender: false, // holds scale 0 / opacity 0 until the click moment
  },
  RIPPLE_AT,
);
```

## Variations

- **Single ring** — one `.ripple`, no stagger; more elegant when the rest of the scene is busy.
- **Keyframed attack-decay** — a `keyframes` block ramps opacity 0 → peak → 0 across the duration; a clearer "energy radiates and dissipates" envelope.
- **Multi-ring expanding pulse** — 3 rings at 0.08 s stagger when the click is the scene's climactic moment.

Reference values: `../../examples/cta-orbit-collapse.html` — 0.5 s move on `back.out(1.3)`, click +0.2 s, press 0.08 s at 0.85/0.95, single ring to 5× over 0.7 s `power2.out`.

## Critical Constraints

- **Move before click** — trigger the click only after the move tween settles; clicking mid-motion reads as unintentional.
- **Rings live in DOM from t=0** at the click-target center with `scale: 0` + `opacity: 0` — never conditionally rendered; `immediateRender: false` on the expand so they hold invisible until the trigger.
- **Ripple from the click point** — the button's visual center, not any element's bounding-box origin.
- **Synchronized depression** — cursor + target depress at the same position with the same duration, and both yoyo back.
- **Cursor above all content** (high z-index) for the whole sequence; `pointer-events: none` on cursor + ripples.

# Physics Press Reaction (Cursor + Element Synced)

Models a real click: a cursor approaches a button, lands, and both compress IN SYNC, then release together. Distinct from [press-release-spring.md](press-release-spring.md) (no cursor — just a press happening); this rule is the COMBINED cursor + element behavior. A single `PRESS_INTENSITY` drives both: press down compresses both to `1 - PRESS_INTENSITY` via **one targets array**, release springs both back to 1.0 with overshoot. The cursor translates to the button's center BEFORE the press starts; after release it may move on or hold.

## Recipe

```html
<button class="btn" id="btn">{ctaCopy}</button>
<!-- Cursor at scene-root level so it translates freely; arrow TIP is the click
     point, so transform-origin: 0 0 — scaling around the tip keeps it stable. -->
<svg class="cursor" id="cursor" style="pointer-events: none; transform-origin: 0 0">…</svg>
```

```js
gsap.set("#cursor", { x: CURSOR_START_X, y: CURSOR_START_Y }); // off-screen / far corner

// Phase 1 — approach
tl.to(
  "#cursor",
  { x: BUTTON_CENTER_X, y: BUTTON_CENTER_Y, duration: APPROACH_DUR, ease: "power2.inOut" },
  APPROACH_START,
);

// Phase 2 — coordinated press down: ONE targets array, same scale
tl.to(
  ["#btn", "#cursor"],
  { scale: 1 - PRESS_INTENSITY, duration: PRESS_DOWN_DUR, ease: "power1.in" },
  PRESS_DOWN_AT,
);

// Phase 3 — release: both spring back together
tl.to(
  ["#btn", "#cursor"],
  { scale: 1, duration: RELEASE_DUR, ease: `back.out(${BOUNCE_FACTOR})` },
  RELEASE_AT,
);

// Phase 4 — inner glow during press, resting shadow on release (contact confirmation)
tl.to(
  "#btn",
  { boxShadow: "{btnPressedShadow}", duration: PRESS_DOWN_DUR, ease: "power1.in" },
  PRESS_DOWN_AT,
);
tl.to(
  "#btn",
  { boxShadow: "{btnRestingShadow}", duration: RELEASE_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  RELEASE_AT,
);

// Cursor optionally exits after the press settles
tl.to(
  "#cursor",
  { x: CURSOR_EXIT_X, y: CURSOR_EXIT_Y, duration: CURSOR_EXIT_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  CURSOR_EXIT_AT,
);
```

## Variations

- **Multiple-element chain press** — press button A → A triggers a swap → cursor moves to button B → presses again; each press is one full down-release sub-routine.
- **Hold press (continuous pressure)** — insert a `HOLD_DUR` window between press-down and release: both scales stay at `1 - PRESS_INTENSITY`, inner glow stays on. Suggests "thinking" or "loading."
- **Synchronized inner-glow pulse** — during the hold, pulse the inset glow with a sine driver: a `{ p: 0 }` proxy tweened to `Math.PI * GLOW_PULSE_CYCLES * 2` on `ease: "none"`, `onUpdate` writing `boxShadow` with `alpha = GLOW_BASE_ALPHA + sin(p) * GLOW_PULSE_AMP`. Suggests "processing."

## Critical Constraints

- **Same press scale on cursor AND button** (one targets array) — only the button scaling makes the cursor "tap on air"; only the cursor scaling makes the button feel disconnected.
- **Cursor arrives BEFORE the press starts** — a clear "cursor over target" moment, or the press is unattributed.
- **`back.out(BOUNCE_FACTOR)` on the release, for both together** — a linear release loses the tactile feel; release MUST come after press.
- **Inner glow appears DURING press, fades on release** — outer shadow shrinks (pushed in), inner glow appears (energy concentrated).
- **Cursor `transform-origin: 0 0`** — the arrow's tip is the click point; scale around the tip keeps it stable. `pointer-events: none` on the cursor.
- **Climax dwell ≥ 1 s** — after release the composition must continue ≥ 1 s; the press is a beat, the viewer needs time to see the result.
- **No real `mouseenter` / `click` events** — HF is a render context; everything runs via the timeline.
